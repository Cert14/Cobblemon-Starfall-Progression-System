# **The Death of a Server**

*A closer look at what Week 1 should deliver to players.*

## Week 1: A Fresh Start

The launch of a server is a shared moment. Everyone logs in chasing the same rush. Discovery. Competition. Progress. Everyone wants to be first. Everyone wants to feel something new.

## The First Mistake: Fast Tracking the Endgame

Nothing ruins a server faster than handing out endgame power too early. During the first week, players hunt for strong Pokémon. Sometimes they get lucky and catch something broken. Maybe even a legendary.

It feels amazing in the moment. Then comes the crash.

The player who catches it has already won. Everyone else feels behind. To compete, they have to grind. EV training. IV breeding. Stat perfecting. Casual players fall off. Exploration, collecting, bonding. All of it fades. The game becomes a checklist. A race. A grind.

That is how servers die. When three legendary Pokémon wipe the entire story mode, there is no journey left to share.

## The Hard Truth

Endgame should feel like a shared achievement, not a solo sprint. It should feel earned, not random. Content gating is not punishment. It protects the experience. It preserves the server.

If you opened a server, you invested your time and vision. You wanted to offer something unique. Two weeks later, your player count drops from fifteen to three. What happened?

Everyone chased legendaries. Everyone wanted to win. But your real audience? They left. The experience was not made for them.

### The Fix

Build a proper progression system. Design each stage to highlight your server features. Give endgame meaning. Make it a goal worth reaching.

Wondering how to handle legendaries? Easy. Create a Pantheon.

## Pantheon of Legendary Pokémon

Break legendaries into tiers. Control their power and availability.

### Tier 1: Proving Grounds (Stages 1 to 3)

These are low base-stat legends. Use them early to add tension without breaking balance.

**Pokémon:**
Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Cresselia, Shaymin (Land), Zarude, Phione, Regice, Regirock, Registeel

**Use Case:**
Roaming encounters, static overworld threats, or early mini-bosses.

### Tier 2: Domain Guardians (Stages 4 to 7)

Mid-tier legendaries. Offer biome-specific bosses or key-triggered events.

**Pokémon:**
Entei, Suicune, Raikou, Latias, Latios, Heatran, Celebi, Virizion, Terrakion, Cobalion, Regigigas, Zygarde (10%)

**Use Case:**
Gate with region progression or merit rank. Encourage team play or economy-driven unlocks.

### Tier 3: Apex Wielders (Stages 8 to 10)

High-stat powerhouses. Require effort, strategy, or group coordination.

**Pokémon:**
Mewtwo, Zapdos, Moltres, Articuno, Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Zygarde (50%), Giratina (Altered), Darkrai

**Use Case:**
Tie to server-wide events, timed unlocks, or complex triggers.

### Tier 4: Divine Class (Final Weeks Only)

Top-tier legends. Game-altering. Must be rare and earned.

**Pokémon:**
Rayquaza, Kyogre, Groudon, Zygarde (Complete), Xerneas, Yveltal, Necrozma (Ultra), Eternatus, Arceus

**Use Case:**
Require max merit, group quests, or multi-week conditions. Their presence should feel legendary.

## Limiting Access

You can take three approaches:

1. **Quest for the Legend**: Only deliver legendaries through scheduled quests. Announce them ahead of time. This mode feels structured but lacks the thrill of a legendary suddenly appearing nearby.

2. **Ownership Limits**: Treat legendary Pokémon as divine beings. Allow players to use them for a fixed time. After that, they return to the wild. Players are blessed with their power, not given permanent control.

3. **The Ideal Balance**: Introduce a weekly legendary after players reach level 40. Start with the lower tier. Each event includes a server-wide quest where everyone can earn one. In the following week, add that Pokémon to the world with a very low spawn chance for those who missed it. Once the server average reaches level 60, unlock all tier one legendaries with a small chance to spawn. Then begin tier two the same way. Continue this model until you reach the final tier. This controls the pace and power of the server without losing the thrill or fairness.

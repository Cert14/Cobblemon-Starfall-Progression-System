## Why Items Must Be Gated ‚Äì The Balance of Power and Pace

Every Cobblemon journey starts with wonder. A new world, a starter Pok√©mon, and the thrill of the unknown. But that thrill fades fast when power comes too soon.

---

## ‚ö° The Early Rush

Give players an Ultra Ball on day one, and they‚Äôll grab the strongest thing they see. Let them farm Black Apricorns without restriction, and they‚Äôll craft a dozen more. Suddenly, what should‚Äôve taken weeks feels over in hours.

Now imagine a new player logging in. They see full teams of overpowered Pok√©mon, perfect stats, and rare items. There‚Äôs no excitement. Only the feeling that they‚Äôre already too far behind.

They don‚Äôt stay.

---

## üîí Why Gating Works

Gating is rhythm.

Each limit builds tension. Each unlock becomes a moment.

A player earning their first Ultra Ball should feel like they‚Äôve reached a new tier. That Black Apricorn wasn‚Äôt handed to them‚Äîthey found it, or unlocked it, or earned it.

The payoff? They care. They pace themselves. They stay.

---

## ‚è≥ Why the Server Lasts Longer

No gates = veterans burn out fast and new players drop off.

But with smart gating:
- Early game stays exciting and fair
- Mid game becomes dynamic and strategic
- Late game feels earned, not rushed

The world has rhythm. The pacing tells a story.

---

## üß† Final Word

Gating is protection.

Let every item be part of a journey.

Let them feel the climb.

That‚Äôs what makes it matter.

## üìå Notes
* The tiers were made with AI, IT NEEDS TO BE CURATED.
* Some items show up twice if their tier context changes (e.g., Sticky Barb).
* Evolution items scale with when their result hits impact.
* Craft parts ranked by what they unlock (not their rarity).
* Ultra Ball gating is crucial to slow legendary rushes.

# EVs, IVs and Competitive Players

**The path to competitive play in a slow-burn server.**

## Layers

Once the legendary issue is managed, we face a less obvious but just as important problem: competitive genetics. EVs, IVs, nature manipulation, and tutor moves create a gap between casual and competitive players.

In Cobblemon, players who understand team composition, optimized stats, and movesets can easily overpower others. The question is not whether to block this knowledge but how to allow skill expression without destroying balance.

We should not punish experienced players. We should challenge them in controlled environments.

## Design Approach

Instead of allowing IV breeders to dominate from day one, create early-game content that rewards creativity over raw stats:

- **Team composition matters:** Build scenarios that favor diverse and unconventional Pok√©mon.
- **Creative sets over raw stats:** Limit EV training and power items early. Encourage strategies that rely on clever moves, not optimized numbers.
- **Meta development:** Delay access to competitive tools. Let the meta grow naturally, giving players time to experiment and adapt.
- **Strategic clues:** Drop early hints about upcoming PvE or PvP themes. For example, suggest that end-of-week content favors speed control. Allow access to Trick Room through quests or rare drops.

## Soft Gating Harmful Mechanics

- **Breeding:** Keep it, but limit it. Add long cooldowns or waiting periods so it cannot be spammed. Use it for progress, not dominance.
- **Vitamins, Mints, EV Items:** Make them rare, hard to craft, and expensive in the early game. They become more accessible later.
- **Held Items:** Avoid giving out powerful held items early. Gatekeep staples like Leftovers or Assault Vest. Allow early game to explore less common setups.

## Rewarding Early PvP Expression

Let skilled players stand out through strategy, not brute force. Give space for diverse playstyles to shine in PvP before raw power becomes overwhelming. As the game matures, balance tilts naturally toward those with better tools. But early on, reward mastery through limitations.

This keeps both casual and competitive players engaged, challenged, and eager to grow.

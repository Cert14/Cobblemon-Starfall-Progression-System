# Balancing the Economy in Cobblemon

In the early days of every server, players enter the world with excitementâ€”catching PokÃ©mon, battling trainers, and exploring every biome. But over time, imbalance crept in. Some players found ways to gain wealth too fast, trading high-value items and breaking the sense of progression.

To bring back fairness and long-term fun, we built a structured economy. Hereâ€™s how we did it:

---

## Unified Currency: CobbleDollars

 **CobbleDollars** as the only currency, making every trade, battle, and purchase revolve around it.

### How:
- **Install CobbleDollars Mod** to add currency and merchant systems
- **Set Up Merchants** in villages to trade items for CobbleDollars
- **Define Earning Rules**: Players earn CobbleDollars from wild PokÃ©mon battles, with rewards based on the PokÃ©monâ€™s level,

---

## Trade Control: Cobblemon GTS

To manage trades fairly, use the **Cobblemon GTS** mod.

### How:
- Install the **Cobblemon GTS Mod** for a global trading system
- **Set Minimum Prices** to prevent dumping
- **Blacklist Items or PokÃ©mon** to stop abuse or manipulation

---

## Daily Earning Cap

To prevent wealth inflation, we took a desition, a **daily CobbleDollar earning cap**.

### How:
- Track earnings using server-side scripts or plugins
- Set a **daily limit** per player
- Implement a **daily reset** synced with server time

---

## ðŸ“Š Transparency and Player Awareness

Players need to understand how the economy works.

### How:
- Display current balance and daily earnings in-game
- Alert players when they approach or hit their earning limit

---

## ðŸ”„ Money Sinks

We created ways to **encourage spending** and prevent hoarding.

### How:
- Sell rare or cosmetic items exclusively for CobbleDollars, as a way to dump the money of the hoarders
- Add service fees in some very specific instances (healing, teleporting, zone access)
- Require entry fees for tournaments and events

By taking these steps, we built a fair and rewarding Cobblemon economyâ€”where every player has a real shot, every coin has value, and every choice matters.

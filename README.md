## 🎯 Server Philosophy

- **Slow, meaningful progression** — Inspired by MMORPGs and classic Pokémon pacing.
- **Weekly unlocks** — New zones, level caps, and features unlock over time.
- **PvE, PvP & Exploration** — A balance of all three gameplay pillars.
- **Realism of how a Pokemon Survival World should be.
- **Lore & Worldbuilding** — Optional world narrative tools and key item integration.
- **No pay-to-win** — All content is earned through gameplay.
